      <br>Raphael is a Biomedical Engineering student at the<br>
       <br>Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology<br>
       <br>I started enrolling in 2022, and I will be ended in 2026<br>


       <h2><U>MY FIELD OF STUDY</U></h2>
       <br>I am interested in Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering<br>
       <br>Biomaterials is a very interesting field of study as a<br>
       <br>Biomedical engineering student. My aim of studying this<br>
       <br>course is to help those out there who are surfering from<br>
       <br>chronic diseases like; kidney failure,lung cancer and what<br>
       <br>have you. In Biomaterials, we develop artificial organs for<br>
       <br>implants and prosthetics.In tissue engineering, we develop<br>
       <br>new tissue to replace damaged ones.<br>

      <h3><u>THE DAILY LIFE OF A BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER</u></h3>
      <br>As a Biomedical Engineer, you will conduct research, along with life scientists,<br>
      <br>chemists, and medical scientists, on the engineering aspects of biological systems<br>
      <br>of humans and animals. Design and develop medical dignostic and clinical instrumentatio,<br>                                    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.vqHHf3p5DhOX9yXI3fu6SwHaGW?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
      <br>equipment, and procedures, using the principles of engineering and behavioral sciences.<br>
